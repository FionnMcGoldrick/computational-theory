    "### Overview\n",
    "The **parity function** is one of the logical functions used in the SHA-1 algorithm. It takes in three 32-bit words and compares their bits to decide the result for each position. Parity looks at each bit of the three inputs and checks if an **odd number of them are 1**. If the number of 1s is odd, the result bit is 1; if it's even, the result bit is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "The parity function works by applying the **XOR operator** to each bit of the three inputs (`x`, `y`, and `z`). XOR returns `1` if the number of `1` bits is **odd**, and `0` if its number of bits is **even**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For exmaple, if we look at a single bit position across `x`, `y`, and `z`:\n",
    "\n",
    "| x | y | z | Result (x ⊕ y ⊕ z) |\n",
    "|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-----------------:|\n",
    "| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n",

    "| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see from the table that the result is `1` whenever **an odd number of inputs are 1**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, this can be done simply by XORing the three values:\n",
    "``x ^ y ^ z``\n",
    "\n",
    "When using 32-bit unsigned integers, this operation is applied to **all 32 bits at once**, producing a new 32-bit result.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also conclude from the table that the order of either the `1` or `0` bits is not significant in the outcome. This means that the parity function is **commutative**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It's Used\n",
    "\n",
    "The parity function is used in **specific rounds of the SHA-1 algorithm** to combine three different 32-bit values in a balanced way. XOR is useful because it dosen't favour any single input - the output changes if **any one** of the inputs changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This properly helps SHA-1 achieve **good diffusion**, meaning small changes in the input data quickly spread through the algorithm and affect many bits of the final hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parity is also very simple to calculate, which makes it efficient to use repeatedly during the hashing process without slowing things down.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the Python implementation of the **parity function**. It takes three 32-bit integers (`x`, `y`, and `z`) and returns their bitwise XOR as a 32-bit unsigned integer. This matches the behavior defined in the SHA-1 standard:\n",

    "It takes three 32-bit words: `x`, `y`, and `z`.  \n",

    "- If the bit of `x` is **1**, the result takes the bit from **`y`**.\n",
    "- If the bit of `x` is **0**, the result takes the bit from **`z`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, people say: **“`x` chooses between `y` and `z`.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Bit-by-bit, the choose function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Ch(x, y, z) = (x AND y) XOR ((NOT x) AND z)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula matches the “choose” idea because of how the bitwise operations work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a bit of **x is 1**, the expression `(x AND y)` keeps the bit from **y** in that position  \n",
    "  At the same time, `(~x AND z)` becomes `0 AND z` for that bit (because NOT 1 = 0), so the bit from **z** is ignored there.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a bit of **x is 0**, `(x AND y)` becomes `0 AND y` → which is always 0.  \n",
    "  Meanwhile, `(~x AND z)` becomes `1 AND z` (because NOT 0 = 1), so the bit from **z** is kept in that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The two parts are then joined together with XOR, but since **only one of the two expressions can produce a 1 for any bit**, XOR here is effectively just combining them without any conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for each bit:\n",
    "- **x = 1** → choose the bit from **y**.  \n",
    "- **x = 0** → choose the bit from **z**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why it’s called the “choose” function — `x` decides, bit by bit, whether to pick the value from `y` or from `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Table:**\n",
    "| x | y | z | Ch(x, y, z) |\n",

    "### Why It’s Used\n",
    "The choose function helps SHA-1 **mix data in a controlled way**:\n",
    "- It lets one value (`x`) **select** bits from two other values (`y` and `z`).\n",
    "- A **single bit change** in `x` can flip which source is chosen at many positions, helping with **diffusion** (small input changes affect many output bits).\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "The **Sigma0** function (often written as `Σ₀`) is a logical function used in SHA-256.  \n",
    "It takes a single 32-bit word `x` and performs three **bitwise right rotations**, then combines the results with XOR.  \n",
    "This function is designed to **scramble bits** efficiently, helping spread input differences across the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Sigma0 is:\n",
    "`Σ₀(x) = ROTR²(x) ⊕ ROTR¹³(x) ⊕ ROTR²²(x)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `ROTRⁿ(x)` means rotating the bits of `x` **n positions to the right**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert `x` to a 32-bit unsigned integer to ensure all operations wrap around properly.  \n",
    "2. Perform three **right rotations**:\n",
    "   - Rotate by 2 bits\n",
    "   - Rotate by 13 bits\n",
    "   - Rotate by 22 bits\n",
    "3. **XOR** the three rotated results together to produce the final 32-bit output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mixing operation ensures that small changes in `x` will affect many output bits, improving **diffusion** in the SHA-256 algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sigma0 function is used in the **SHA-256 compression step** to ensure that the bits of the working variables are **well-diffused**.  \n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- A **small change in the input** will cause a **large, unpredictable change** in the output.  \n",
    "- It introduces **non-linearity** without losing information, since rotations keep all bits.  \n",
    "- It strengthens the hash function against **collision** and **preimage** attacks by increasing bit interdependence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sigma0, together with Sigma1, plays a key role in **updating the message schedule and state** during each round of SHA-256.\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "The **sigma0** function (often written as `σ₀`) is a logical function used in **SHA-256**.  \n",
    "It takes a single 32-bit word `x` and applies a combination of **two right rotations** and **one right shift**, then XORs the results together.  \n",
    "This function is part of the **message schedule** in SHA-256 and helps to mix bits in a way that’s both efficient and unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for sigma0 is:\n",
    "`σ₀(x) = ROTR⁷(x) ⊕ ROTR¹⁸(x) ⊕ SHR³(x)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `ROTRⁿ(x)` means rotating the bits of `x` **n positions to the right** (bits wrap around).  \n",
    "- `SHRⁿ(x)` means shifting the bits of `x` **n positions to the right**, with zeros filled on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert `x` to a 32-bit unsigned integer to keep all operations within 32 bits.  \n",
    "2. Perform two **right rotations**:\n",
    "   - Rotate by 7 bits\n",
    "   - Rotate by 18 bits\n",
    "3. Perform a **right shift** by 3 bits (bits are shifted out and replaced with zeros).  \n",
    "4. XOR the three results together to get the final value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of rotations and a shift ensures that the bits are **rearranged and mixed**, while also introducing some **asymmetry** (because shifting loses information, unlike rotating).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigma0 function is used during the **message schedule expansion** in SHA-256.  \n",
    "- It helps spread the influence of each bit of the message across many positions.  \n",
    "- The mix of rotations and a shift makes the output **less predictable** and improves **diffusion**, which strengthens security.  \n",
    "- Sigma0 ensures that even small changes in the input will affect multiple bits in the expanded message, helping to achieve the **avalanche effect** early in the hashing process.\n",
