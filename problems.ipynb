    "For this problem, I need to re-create some of the core building blocks used inside the **SHA-256 hashing algorithm**. The **SHA-256** algorithm is a **cryptographic hash function** that turns a given input into a series of hexadecimal values **(fixed 256-bit hash)**. Hashes, unlike encryptions, are long and **can not be reversed**. One input will always output the same hash code making hashing extremely useful for something like storing and validating passwords. These blocks are small functions that work on 32-bit binary words, and they mostly use bitwise logic like ``XOR``, ``AND``, ``OR``, **rotations**, and **shifts**.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "**SHA-256** is a **cryptographic hash function** from the **Secure Hash Standard**. Its job is to take any input and turn it into a **fixed 256-bit hash value**. This value is **one-way**, meaning you can’t reverse it to get the original message. It’s also **deterministic**, so the same input always gives the same output, and it’s designed to **avoid collisions**, where two different inputs produce the same hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** was developed by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** and released in **2001** as part of the **Secure Hash Standard (FIPS PUB 180-2)**. It was introduced to replace older hash functions like **SHA-1**(which is now deprecated) and to provide a stronger, modern hashing method for security, digital signatures, and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by splitting the message into **512-bit blocks** and running them through a series of bitwise operations like ``XOR``, ``AND``, **rotations**, and **shifts**. Functions such as ``Ch``, ``Maj``, and the ``Sigma`` functions help mix the bits so that even a 1-bit change in the input causes a completely different output. This is called the **avalanche effect**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Parity Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **Parity function**, I followed the definition from the **SHA standard**, which states that parity is computed using a bitwise ``XOR`` across the three input values. I first converted ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` to ``np.uint32`` to ensure they behave as **32-bit words**, since **SHA-256** relies on strict 32-bit operations. After that, I applied ``XOR`` to all three values, because ``XOR`` naturally produces the correct parity: **each bit in the output becomes 1 if an odd number of the input bits are 1**. This matches the behaviour needed for SHA-style logical functions and keeps the implementation simple and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because **XOR naturally implements parity: it sets a bit to 1 only when an odd number of the input bits are 1**, which is exactly what the **SHA** standard requires. Converting the inputs to ``np.uint32`` ensures the function behaves like a true 32-bit operation, matching how **SHA-256** handles all of its internal values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Choose Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **Choose function**, I followed the formula defined in the **SHA-256** standard, where each output bit is selected from either ``y`` or ``z`` depending on the corresponding bit in ``x``. If a bit in ``x`` is **1**, the bit from ``y`` **is chosen**, and if it is **0**, the bit from ``z`` **is chosen**. To match the behaviour of the algorithm, I first **converted all inputs to ``np.uint32`` so that the operation stays within 32-bit boundaries**. After that, I implemented the expression ``(x & y) ^ (~x & z)``, which is the exact **logical form used inside the SHA-256 compression function**. This ensures that each bit is selected correctly based on ``x`` and follows the rules laid out in the official specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because this expression is the direct translation of how the **Choose function** is defined in the **SHA standard**. The combination of bitwise ``AND``, ``NOT``, and ``XOR`` cleanly selects between ``y`` and ``z`` using the bits of ``x``, and using ``np.uint32`` **keeps everything consistent** with **SHA-256’s** strict 32-bit word operations."

    "### Overview\n",
    "The **choose function** (often written as `Ch`) is another logical function used in SHA-1.  \n",
    "It takes three 32-bit words: `x`, `y`, and `z`.  \n",
    "For each bit position, it **chooses** between `y` and `z` based on the bit of `x`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the bit of `x` is **1**, the result takes the bit from **`y`**.\n",
    "- If the bit of `x` is **0**, the result takes the bit from **`z`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, people say: **“`x` chooses between `y` and `z`.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Bit-by-bit, the choose function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Ch(x, y, z) = (x AND y) XOR ((NOT x) AND z)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula matches the “choose” idea because of how the bitwise operations work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a bit of **x is 1**, the expression `(x AND y)` keeps the bit from **y** in that position  \n",
    "  At the same time, `(~x AND z)` becomes `0 AND z` for that bit (because NOT 1 = 0), so the bit from **z** is ignored there.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a bit of **x is 0**, `(x AND y)` becomes `0 AND y` → which is always 0.  \n",
    "  Meanwhile, `(~x AND z)` becomes `1 AND z` (because NOT 0 = 1), so the bit from **z** is kept in that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The two parts are then joined together with XOR, but since **only one of the two expressions can produce a 1 for any bit**, XOR here is effectively just combining them without any conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for each bit:\n",
    "- **x = 1** → choose the bit from **y**.  \n",
    "- **x = 0** → choose the bit from **z**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why it’s called the “choose” function — `x` decides, bit by bit, whether to pick the value from `y` or from `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Table:**\n",
    "| x | y | z | Ch(x, y, z) |\n",

    "- When **x=0**, the output equals **z**.  \n",
    "- When **x=1**, the output equals **y**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It’s Used\n",
    "The choose function helps SHA-1 **mix data in a controlled way**:\n",
    "- It lets one value (`x`) **select** bits from two other values (`y` and `z`).\n",
    "- A **single bit change** in `x` can flip which source is chosen at many positions, helping with **diffusion** (small input changes affect many output bits).\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "The **majority function** (often written as `Maj`) is another logical function used in SHA-1.  \n",
    "It takes three 32-bit words: `x`, `y`, and `z`.  \n",
    "For each bit position, it outputs the **majority value** among the three bits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If **at least two of the bits are 1**, the result is **1**.  \n",
    "- If **at least two of the bits are 0**, the result is **0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why it's called the **majority** function — the output reflects whichever value (0 or 1) is in the majority among `x`, `y`, and `z` for each bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Bit-by-bit, the majority function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Maj(x, y, z) = (x AND y) XOR (x AND z) XOR (y AND z)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula works because:\n",
    "- If **at least two inputs** have a 1 at a bit position, then **at least one** of the AND combinations will be 1, and the XOR of the three terms will produce 1.\n",
    "- If fewer than two bits are 1, all AND combinations will be 0, so the output will be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| x | y | z | Maj(x, y, z) |\n",
    "|:-:|:-:|:-:|:------------:|\n",
    "| 0 | 0 | 0 |      0       |\n",
    "| 0 | 0 | 1 |      0       |\n",
    "| 0 | 1 | 0 |      0       |\n",

    "| 1 | 0 | 1 |      1       |\n",
    "| 1 | 1 | 0 |      1       |\n",
    "| 1 | 1 | 1 |      1       |\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the pattern:  \n",
    "- When **at least two bits are 1**, the output is 1.  \n",
    "- When fewer than two bits are 1, the output is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It’s Used\n",
    "The majority function helps SHA-1 **mix data** in a way that depends on **the agreement between bits** of three different words.  \n",
    "It is used in certain rounds of SHA-1 to introduce **non-linearity** and improve **diffusion**.  \n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "The **Sigma0** function (often written as `Σ₀`) is a logical function used in SHA-256.  \n",
    "It takes a single 32-bit word `x` and performs three **bitwise right rotations**, then combines the results with XOR.  \n",
    "This function is designed to **scramble bits** efficiently, helping spread input differences across the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Sigma0 is:\n",
    "`Σ₀(x) = ROTR²(x) ⊕ ROTR¹³(x) ⊕ ROTR²²(x)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `ROTRⁿ(x)` means rotating the bits of `x` **n positions to the right**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert `x` to a 32-bit unsigned integer to ensure all operations wrap around properly.  \n",
    "2. Perform three **right rotations**:\n",
    "   - Rotate by 2 bits\n",
    "   - Rotate by 13 bits\n",
    "   - Rotate by 22 bits\n",
    "3. **XOR** the three rotated results together to produce the final 32-bit output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mixing operation ensures that small changes in `x` will affect many output bits, improving **diffusion** in the SHA-256 algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sigma0 function is used in the **SHA-256 compression step** to ensure that the bits of the working variables are **well-diffused**.  \n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- A **small change in the input** will cause a **large, unpredictable change** in the output.  \n",
    "- It introduces **non-linearity** without losing information, since rotations keep all bits.  \n",
    "- It strengthens the hash function against **collision** and **preimage** attacks by increasing bit interdependence.  \n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "The **sigma0** function (often written as `σ₀`) is a logical function used in **SHA-256**.  \n",
    "It takes a single 32-bit word `x` and applies a combination of **two right rotations** and **one right shift**, then XORs the results together.  \n",
    "This function is part of the **message schedule** in SHA-256 and helps to mix bits in a way that’s both efficient and unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for sigma0 is:\n",
    "`σ₀(x) = ROTR⁷(x) ⊕ ROTR¹⁸(x) ⊕ SHR³(x)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `ROTRⁿ(x)` means rotating the bits of `x` **n positions to the right** (bits wrap around).  \n",
    "- `SHRⁿ(x)` means shifting the bits of `x` **n positions to the right**, with zeros filled on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert `x` to a 32-bit unsigned integer to keep all operations within 32 bits.  \n",
    "2. Perform two **right rotations**:\n",
    "   - Rotate by 7 bits\n",
    "   - Rotate by 18 bits\n",
    "3. Perform a **right shift** by 3 bits (bits are shifted out and replaced with zeros).  \n",
    "4. XOR the three results together to get the final value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of rotations and a shift ensures that the bits are **rearranged and mixed**, while also introducing some **asymmetry** (because shifting loses information, unlike rotating).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigma0 function is used during the **message schedule expansion** in SHA-256.  \n",
    "- It helps spread the influence of each bit of the message across many positions.  \n",
    "- The mix of rotations and a shift makes the output **less predictable** and improves **diffusion**, which strengthens security.  \n",
