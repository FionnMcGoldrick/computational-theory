    "For this problem, I need to re-create some of the core building blocks used inside the **SHA-256 hashing algorithm**. The **SHA-256** algorithm is a **cryptographic hash function** that turns a given input into a series of hexadecimal values **(fixed 256-bit hash)**. Hashes, unlike encryptions, are long and **can not be reversed**. One input will always output the same hash code making hashing extremely useful for something like storing and validating passwords. These blocks are small functions that work on 32-bit binary words, and they mostly use bitwise logic like ``XOR``, ``AND``, ``OR``, **rotations**, and **shifts**.\n",

    "**SHA-256** is a **cryptographic hash function** from the **Secure Hash Standard**. Its job is to take any input and turn it into a **fixed 256-bit hash value**. This value is **one-way**, meaning you can’t reverse it to get the original message. It’s also **deterministic**, so the same input always gives the same output, and it’s designed to **avoid collisions**, where two different inputs produce the same hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** was developed by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** and released in **2001** as part of the **Secure Hash Standard (FIPS PUB 180-2)**. It was introduced to replace older hash functions like **SHA-1**(which is now deprecated) and to provide a stronger, modern hashing method for security, digital signatures, and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by splitting the message into **512-bit blocks** and running them through a series of bitwise operations like ``XOR``, ``AND``, **rotations**, and **shifts**. Functions such as ``Ch``, ``Maj``, and the ``Sigma`` functions help mix the bits so that even a 1-bit change in the input causes a completely different output. This is called the **avalanche effect**.\n",

    "## Aproach\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Parity Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **Parity function**, I followed the definition from the **SHA standard**, which states that parity is computed using a bitwise **XOR** across the three input values. I first converted ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` to ``np.uint32`` to ensure they behave as **32-bit words**, since **SHA-256** relies on strict 32-bit operations. After that, I applied **XOR** to all three values, because **XOR** naturally produces the correct parity: **each bit in the output becomes 1 if an odd number of the input bits are 1**. This matches the behaviour needed for SHA-style logical functions and keeps the implementation simple and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because **XOR naturally implements parity: it sets a bit to 1 only when an odd number of the input bits are 1**, which is exactly what the **SHA** standard requires. Converting the inputs to ``np.uint32`` ensures the function behaves like a true 32-bit operation, matching how **SHA-256** handles all of its internal values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Choose Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **Choose function**, I followed the formula defined in the **SHA-256** standard, where each output bit is selected from either ``y`` or ``z`` depending on the corresponding bit in ``x``. If a bit in ``x`` is **1**, the bit from ``y`` **is chosen**, and if it is **0**, the bit from ``z`` **is chosen**. To match the behaviour of the algorithm, I first **converted all inputs to ``np.uint32`` so that the operation stays within 32-bit boundaries**. After that, I implemented the expression ``(x & y) ^ (~x & z)``, which is the exact **logical form used inside the SHA-256 compression function**. This ensures that each bit is selected correctly based on ``x`` and follows the rules laid out in the official specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because this expression is the direct translation of how the **Choose function** is defined in the **SHA standard**. The combination of bitwise **AND**, **NOT**, and **XOR** cleanly selects between ``y`` and ``z`` using the bits of ``x``, and using ``np.uint32`` **keeps everything consistent** with **SHA-256’s** strict 32-bit word operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Sigma0 Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ``Sigma0`` function, I used the formula from the **SHA-256** standard, which says that ``Sigma0`` is created by **rotating the input word three times: by 2 bits, 13 bits, and 22 bits**, and then **XORing** all of those results together. Before doing the rotations, I converted the input to ``np.uint32`` so it always behaves like a **32-bit word**, just like **SHA-256** requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because **SHA-256 depends on bitwise rotations to mix the bits of the message**. Using the **three rotations** and **XOR** gives the spreading effect the algorithm needs, and converting the value to ``np.uint32`` makes sure the rotations wrap around correctly and stay within 32 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Sigma1 Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ``Sigma1`` function, I followed the formula from the **SHA-256** standard, which defines ``Sigma1`` by **rotating the input word three times**: by **6 bits, 11 bits, and 25 bits**, and then **XORing** the results together. Just like the other **SHA functions**, I first converted the input to ``np.uint32`` so it behaves as a proper **32-bit word** and the rotations wrap around correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because ``Sigma1`` is one of the main mixing functions in **SHA-256**, and these specific rotations help spread the bits of the word in a controlled way. The combination of the three rotations and **XOR** creates strong bit mixing, which is important for the security of the hash. Converting the input to ``np.uint32`` ensures the function matches the exact **32-bit** behaviour defined in the **SHA-256** specification.\n"

    "### Overview\n",
    "The **sigma1** function (often written as `σ₁`) is a logical function used in **SHA-256**.  \n",
    "It takes a single 32-bit word `x` and applies a combination of **two right rotations** and **one right shift**, then XORs the results together.  \n",
    "This function is part of the **message schedule expansion** and helps spread the influence of the input bits in a way that improves security.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for sigma1 is:\n",
    "`σ₁(x) = ROTR¹⁷(x) ⊕ ROTR¹⁹(x) ⊕ SHR¹⁰(x)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `ROTRⁿ(x)` rotates the bits of `x` **n positions to the right** (bits wrap around).  \n",
    "- `SHRⁿ(x)` shifts the bits of `x` **n positions to the right**, filling in zeros on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert `x` to a 32-bit unsigned integer to keep all operations within 32 bits.  \n",
    "2. Perform two **right rotations**:\n",
    "   - Rotate by 17 bits\n",
    "   - Rotate by 19 bits\n",
    "3. Perform a **right shift** by 10 bits (bits shifted out are discarded, zeros fill in from the left).  \n",
    "4. XOR the three results together to get the final 32-bit output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination allows sigma1 to **rearrange and mix bits** effectively, using both rotations (which keep all information) and a shift (which loses some bits) to make the transformation less predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigma1 function is used during the **message schedule** stage of SHA-256 to expand the original message into many derived words.  \n",
    "- It helps ensure that each original message bit affects **many future computations**.  \n",
    "- Rotations and shifts together provide **non-linearity** and **diffusion**, making the hash much harder to reverse or predict.  \n",
    "- It supports the **avalanche effect**, where a tiny change in the input causes widespread changes in the output.\n",
