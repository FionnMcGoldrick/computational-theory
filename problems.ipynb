Hashes, unlike encryptions, are long and **can not be reversed**. One input will always output the same hash code making hashing extremely useful for something like storing and validating passwords. These blocks are small functions that work on 32-bit binary words, and they mostly use bitwise logic like ``XOR``, ``AND``, ``OR``, **rotations**, and **shifts**.\n",

    "## Theory / Background \n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** is a **cryptographic hash function** from the **Secure Hash Standard**. Its job is to take any input and turn it into a **fixed 256-bit hash value**. This value is **one-way**, meaning you can’t reverse it to get the original message. It’s also **deterministic**, so the same input always gives the same output, and it’s designed to **avoid collisions**, where two different inputs produce the same hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256** was developed by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** and released in **2001** as part of the **Secure Hash Standard (FIPS PUB 180-2)**. It was introduced to replace older hash functions like **SHA-1**(which is now deprecated) and to provide a stronger, modern hashing method for security, digital signatures, and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by splitting the message into **512-bit blocks** and running them through a series of bitwise operations like ``XOR``, ``AND``, **rotations**, and **shifts**. Functions such as ``Ch``, ``Maj``, and the ``Sigma`` functions help mix the bits so that even a 1-bit change in the input causes a completely different output. This is called the **avalanche effect**.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Aproach\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Parity Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **Parity function**, I followed the definition from the **SHA standard**, which states that parity is computed using a bitwise **XOR** across the three input values. I first converted ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` to ``np.uint32`` to ensure they behave as **32-bit words**, since **SHA-256** relies on strict 32-bit operations. After that, I applied **XOR** to all three values, because **XOR** naturally produces the correct parity: **each bit in the output becomes 1 if an odd number of the input bits are 1**. This matches the behaviour needed for SHA-style logical functions and keeps the implementation simple and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because **XOR naturally implements parity: it sets a bit to 1 only when an odd number of the input bits are 1**, which is exactly what the **SHA** standard requires. Converting the inputs to ``np.uint32`` ensures the function behaves like a true 32-bit operation, matching how **SHA-256** handles all of its internal values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Choose Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **Choose function**, I followed the formula defined in the **SHA-256** standard, where each output bit is selected from either ``y`` or ``z`` depending on the corresponding bit in ``x``. If a bit in ``x`` is **1**, the bit from ``y`` **is chosen**, and if it is **0**, the bit from ``z`` **is chosen**. To match the behaviour of the algorithm, I first **converted all inputs to ``np.uint32`` so that the operation stays within 32-bit boundaries**. After that, I implemented the expression ``(x & y) ^ (~x & z)``, which is the exact **logical form used inside the SHA-256 compression function**. This ensures that each bit is selected correctly based on ``x`` and follows the rules laid out in the official specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because this expression is the direct translation of how the **Choose function** is defined in the **SHA standard**. The combination of bitwise **AND**, **NOT**, and **XOR** cleanly selects between ``y`` and ``z`` using the bits of ``x``, and using ``np.uint32`` **keeps everything consistent** with **SHA-256’s** strict 32-bit word operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Majority Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **Majority function** (`Maj`), I followed the rule from the **SHA-256** standard, which says that **each bit in the output should be the value that appears in at least two of the three inputs**. To make sure the function behaves like **SHA-256**, I first converted ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` to ``np.uint32`` so they act as proper **32-bit words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because the expression ``(x & y) ^ (x & z) ^ (y & z)`` is the exact formula the standard uses. It **checks all three inputs bit-by-bit and picks the majority value**. Using ``np.uint32`` keeps the operations inside **32 bits** and makes sure the behaviour matches what actually happens inside the **SHA-256** algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Sigma0 Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ``Sigma0`` function, I used the formula from the **SHA-256** standard, which says that ``Sigma0`` is created by **rotating the input word three times: by 2 bits, 13 bits, and 22 bits**, and then **XORing** all of those results together. Before doing the rotations, I converted the input to ``np.uint32`` so it always behaves like a **32-bit word**, just like **SHA-256** requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because **SHA-256 depends on bitwise rotations to mix the bits of the message**. Using the **three rotations** and **XOR** gives the spreading effect the algorithm needs, and converting the value to ``np.uint32`` makes sure the rotations wrap around correctly and stay within 32 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Sigma1 Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ``Sigma1`` function, I followed the formula from the **SHA-256** standard, which defines ``Sigma1`` by **rotating the input word three times**: by **6 bits, 11 bits, and 25 bits**, and then **XORing** the results together. Just like the other **SHA functions**, I first converted the input to ``np.uint32`` so it behaves as a proper **32-bit word** and the rotations wrap around correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because ``Sigma1`` is one of the main mixing functions in **SHA-256**, and these specific rotations help spread the bits of the word in a controlled way. The combination of the three rotations and **XOR** creates strong bit mixing, which is important for the security of the hash. Converting the input to ``np.uint32`` ensures the function matches the exact **32-bit** behaviour defined in the **SHA-256** specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. sigma0 Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **small** ``sigma0`` function, I followed the formula from the **SHA-256** standard, which uses **two right-rotations (by 7 bits and 18 bits) and a right-shift by 3 bits**. After converting the input to ``np.uint32``, I applied these operations and combined the results using **XOR**, just like the specification requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because **small sigma** functions are used in the message schedule of **SHA-256** to help expand and mix the message words. The mix of rotations and a shift creates the variation the algorithm needs, and converting to ``np.uint32`` keeps everything inside proper 32-bit behaviour so the function matches the real **SHA-256** process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. sigma1 Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **small** ``sigma1`` function, I used the formula from the **SHA-256** standard, which applies **two right-rotations to the input word (by 17 bits and 19 bits) and then a right-shift by 10 bits**. After converting the input to ``np.uint32``, I **combined all three results using XOR**, exactly as the specification describes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved it this way because the **small sigma** functions are **used in the message schedule part of SHA-256**, where the algorithm expands and mixes the message words. The **rotations and the shift help create variation in the bits**, and using ``np.uint32`` keeps everything inside proper 32-bit boundaries, which is required for the correct behaviour of the algorithm.\n"

    "\n",
    "The results from my tests show that all seven functions behave exactly like the **Secure Hash Standard** describes. Converting every value to ``np.uint32`` kept the operations strictly within **32 bits**, which is important because **SHA-256** depends on fixed-size words. The outputs for simple inputs *(like all zeros or all ones)* matched what I expected, and the more complex inputs showed clear bit-mixing, which is the whole purpose of the **Sigma** and **sigma** functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, my approach was correct and gave outputs consistent with real **SHA-256** behaviour. For now I used numpy to make the **32-bit** handling easier, but later I’d like to try implementing these functions without numpy, using manual masks and rotations. That would make the code more complex, but it would also help me understand how cryptographic code controls bit boundaries when the language doesn’t do it automatically.\n",

    "Use **numpy** to calculate the constants listed at the bottom of page 11 of the **Secure Hash Standard**, following the steps below. These are the first `32 bits` of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function called ``primes(n)`` that generates the **first n prime numbers**.\n",

    "1. Use the function to **calculate the cube root of the first** ``64 primes``.\n",

    "1. Test the results against what is in the **Secure Hash Standard**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Understanding \n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, I need to recreate the constants that **SHA-256** uses in its compression function. **These constants come from the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers**, which is what the **[Secure Hash Standard describes on page 11](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/180-2/final)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I **first need a function that can generate prime numbers, because the standard specifically uses the first 64 primes**. Once I have the primes, I must **calculate their cube roots**, and then **extract only the fractional part** *(everything after the decimal)*. After that, I **scale the fractional part so that I can take the first 32 bits of it, convert that into an integer, and display it in hexadecimal**. These hex values should match the constants shown in the official document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this problem is about understanding how **SHA-256** chooses its constants. Even though the final values look random, they are actually produced by a mathematical. My job is to follow that rule exactly using **Python** and **NumPy**, and then compare my results to the values listed in the **Secure Hash Standard** to make sure my implementation is correct."
